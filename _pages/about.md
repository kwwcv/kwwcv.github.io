# About Me
I received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2021, where I'm currently pursuing the M.S. degree supervised by Prof. Zhiguo-Cao with the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation. My current research interests are small object detection and monocular 3D object detection.
